        <h6>One on One</h6>
        <p>
          We are interested in getting to know our investors, property owners,
          and you. We'll go over your expectations, prior experiences, investing
          plan, and financial goals. Currently, how many properties do you own
          and manage? Which kinds of real estate do you own? Which would you
          prefer—continuous contact? What do you think about the services that
          property managers offer, and what makes you feel that way? What does a
          well-kept home represent to you?{" "}

        <p>
          Our constant goal is to get the best return on investment for
          homeowners, both single-family and multifamily. We are aware that our
          client's happiness depends on this. Proven resident screening
          services, a highly qualified leasing staff, and market comparison
          tools that allow rental rate modifications depending on local pricing
          and availability are all components of a strong resident acquisition
          and retention plan.

          Precise reporting is necessary for benchmarking financial objectives.
          In addition to helping with utility rate negotiations and vendor
          contracts, our property management staff gives owners access to
          monthly bills, renovation cost estimates, and flip expenses.

        <h6>Physical Access Management</h6>
        <p>
          To maintain high property values for owners, we offer Preventive
          Maintenance plans, yearly unit inspections, and physical asset
          analyses. Properties that are well-maintained command the greatest
          market prices and require less management.

        <h6>Evictions and Collections</h6>
        <p>
          Even though it doesn't happen very often, there can be a situation
          where we have to evict a tenant due to unpaid rent, a broken lease, or
          criminal conduct. This may damage your rental property and cause
          disturbances in the area. We manage every step of the collection and
          eviction procedure on your behalf. Hiring a legal team with experience
          in home evictions is not necessary. The resident account is billed for
          the filing fees and the expenditures associated with the eviction. We
          take care of recovering bad debt and restoring your property to
          occupied, market-ready condition when the eviction case goes to court
          and you receive a verdict.
